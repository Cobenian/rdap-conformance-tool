# RDAP Conformance Tool (rdapct)

The RDAP Conformance Tool is a stand-alone tool acting like a test suite that verifies the conformity of an RDAP server against 
the specifications developed by the IETF (RFC7481, RFC7482, RFC7483, RFC7484) and the ICANN gTLD RDAP
profile (https://www.icann.org/gtld-rdap-profile). It only tests RDAP servers related to domains. 
Apart from generic RDAP tests, there are no specific tests for IP addresses and AS Numbers RDAP servers.

This tool implements more than 300 tests, as detailed in the doc directory.

The tool is divided into two modules with their respective documentation:

- [Command line module (tool)](./tool/README.md) the main entry point
- [Validator module](./validator/README.md) the rdap validation library

# Usage

There is no installation needed. Building the tool (see below) creates a JAVA11 jar file that can be executed with
java, e.g.:

    java -jar rdapct-1.0.jar -c ./rdapct-config.json https://rdap.registry.com/domain/example.com

where rdapct-config.json is the configuration file.

The tool do the query specified on the command line, parses the response and test the response. It also do other queries
to the server such as the /help query.

The result code shows the primary issue, if any, of all issues found. The details of the tests are found in the results 
directory.

Queries such as domain, nameserver, entity are supported. Basic search (RFC 7482) is also supported.

# Finding the RDAP server

To find the RDAP server for a domain, look at the IANA Bootstrap Service Registry for Domain Name Space 
(https://www.iana.org/assignments/rdap-dns/rdap-dns.xhtml) and look for the TLD of the domain. The second element
of the array for that TLD is the URL of the RDAP server. To lookup for a domain, just add domain to the URL 
followed by the domain itself.

# Configuration file

Configuration definition
The definition file specifies which single tests are errors, warnings, or ignored (i.e. not tested for).
Note: a definition file is required for starting a test.
A configuration definition file specifies:

- definitionIdentifier: a required JSON string that identifies the configuration definition file.
  The string is copied verbatim to the definitionIdentifier element of the results file.
- definitionError: an optional JSON array of objects.
    - Each object contains the following elements:
        - code: a required JSON number that identifies a single test.
        - notes: a required JSON string that is copied verbatim if the test fails, generating an
          entry in the results section in the results file.
- definitionWarning: an optional JSON array of objects.
    - Each object contains the following elements:
        - code: a required JSON number that identifies a single test.
        - notes: an optional JSON string that is copied verbatim if the test fails, generating an
          entry in the results section in the results file.
- definitionIgnore: an optional JSON array of single test identifiers that are ignored (i.e. not
  tested for). The contents of this element are copied verbatim to the ignore section in the results
  file.
- definitionNotes: an optional JSON array of strings that are copied verbatim to the notes section
  in the results file.

## Minimal config file

The simplest config file one can write looks like this:

```
{
    "definitionIdentifier": "test"
}
```

This config file will simply tells the tool to put the id "test" inside the output result file. This
id allows the user to discriminate test runs between each other.

## A more complete example

A more complete example of a configuration definition file is shown below:

```
{
    "definitionIdentifier": "gTLD Profile Version 1.0",
    "definitionError": [{
        "code": -1102,
        "notes": "If the gTLD is a legacy gTLD, this may not indicate an error, review by a person is required."
    }],
    "definitionWarning": [{
        "code": -2186,
        "notes": "This only applies for a few gTLDs."
    }],
    "definitionIgnore": [-2323, -2345, -2346],
    "definitionNotes": ["This is a configuration definition for a legacy gTLD.", "Developed by ICANN."]
}
```

# How to build this project

This is a maven project: to build the executable jar simply run

    mvn package -DskipTests

# Requirements

- Java 11

# Internals

This software fetches various datasets to be used for doing the tests. These datasets are fetched from IANA registries,
saved into the datasets directory, and parsed by the various tests as needed.
The datasets are:
- RDAPExtensionsDataset: https://www.iana.org/assignments/rdap-extensions/rdap-extensions.xml
- RegistrarIdDataset: https://www.iana.org/assignments/registrar-ids/registrar-ids.xml
